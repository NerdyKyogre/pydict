# pydict
A basic interactive dictionary in Python I made as a computer science class project.
Finds the definition of any word, with autocorrect and a graphical interface.
Entering an empty string gives a random definition!
As usual, pre-compiled binaries are available for Windows and Linux, and the script works on any platform. 

# Installing
Option A (Windows/Linux): Grab the zip from the Releases page. Run the "dict" executable inside.

Option B (Cross Platform):

Download the source code by opening a terminal and running

```
git clone https://github.com/NerdyKyogre/pydict
```
Then, if you haven't already, install pyautogui by running

```
python3 -m pip install pyautogui
```

Then, run the script!
